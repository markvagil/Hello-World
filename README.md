# Overview

* This program just prints "Hello World" in the output window when you run it.

* The purpose for creating this software is to be able to become familiar with how github and visual studio code interact so that I am able to comfortably and proficiently use each program to create and store my projects online.

# Development Environment

* The tool that I used to develop the software was Visual Studio Code. This is my favorite Integraded Development Environment because it is a very lightweight program yet it still includes a lot of advanced functionality.
* The programming language that I used to complete this project is Python in version 3.7.8 64-bit. It is a very interesting and unique language which is based around object oriented programming and I enjoy using it very much.
* Github is the online repository I used to store this project.
